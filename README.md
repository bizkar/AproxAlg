About this Course
Approximation algorithms, Part 2 This is the continuation of Approximation algorithms, Part 1. 
Here you will learn linear programming duality applied to the design of some approximation algorithms, and semidefinite programming 
applied to Maxcut. By taking the two parts of this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of 
theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, 
when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be 
able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem. The course content 
and in particular the homework is of a theoretical nature without any programming assignments. This is the second of a two-part 
course on Approximation Algorithms.
